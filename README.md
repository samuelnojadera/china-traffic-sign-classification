# Classifying Traffic Signs using a CNN

## Data
The data was acquired from:
  http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/pal/trafficdata/recognition.html

Because the dataset is too big, it is not included in the repository. However, it can be accessed from:
  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C_sF_xbBoqOxBxpqbt7BSQQU_GLUvFZy?usp=sharing
  
  
  _To replicate the code, the data set should be placed in a folder "data" in the working directory_
